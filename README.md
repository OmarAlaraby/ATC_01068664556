## Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend/         # Django REST API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend/        # HTML/CSS/JavaScript client
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmarAlaraby/ATC_01068664556.git

### Cloudinary
Used for image hosting and management

</td>
<td>

1. Create a Cloudinary account at https://cloudinary.com/
2. Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
3. Configure in `.env` file as shown in `.env.example`

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### PostgreSQL Database
For production database (SQLite used for development)

</td>
<td>

1. Create a PostgreSQL database
2. Update database connection details in `.env` file
3. See `.env.example` for configuration format

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Note**: Refer to `.env.example` in the Backend directory for the complete configuration structure.

## Test Credentials

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Use these credentials to test the application locally with SQLite

<div align="center">

```
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: 123

Email: test_user@gmail.com
Password: test_password@1234

## Email Verification

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The system sends verification emails that need to be configured

<div align="center">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Email_Verification-Required-important" alt="Email Verification Required">
</div>

The signup process includes email verification:

1. When a user registers, a verification email is sent to their email address
2. To enable this feature in your development environment, you need to:
   - Configure email settings in the `.env` file
   - Provide your SMTP server details (or use console backend for testing)
   - In development mode without proper email configuration, check your console output for the verification link

## Unit Testing

<div align="center">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-Automated-success" alt="Tests Automated">
</div>

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure functionality works as expected:

```bash
# Navigate to the Backend directory
cd Backend

# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test events
python manage.py test accounts
python manage.py test tickets
```

Test coverage includes:
- User authentication and registration
- Event creation, retrieval, updates and deletion
- Ticket booking functionality
- Permission controls
- API endpoint validation

Running tests regularly helps ensure that code changes don't introduce regressions.

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password handling
